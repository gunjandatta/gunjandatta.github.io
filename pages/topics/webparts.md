## Classic vs Modern WebParts

### [Classic](./webparts-classic.md)

The framework has pre-configured webparts to help generate minimize code so you only need to focus on the main application and not the configuration or data source. The webparts are pre-configured content/script editor webparts that are added/removed from a site collection's webpart gallery.

### [Modern](./webparts-modern.md)

The framework has modernized the classic webparts. The modern webpart has a similar approach, but utilizes the `configuration` custom webpart property to store its JSON configuration data. The webpart configuration will automatically be updated to include a `Configuration` button that will display the same modal form we have created for the classic webparts.
